# Final-Project
In my final project I decided to answer the question of what is the best first word to play in wordle? what should I play next? and to write a program to help me do so. I have created a code that once you run it, the computer will give you an output on the target word you were trying to guess and the amount of guesses it took to find the word. To answer the question of whats the best first word to play in wordle, the answer would be that there isn't a specific word that is best just a word that has 5 different characters. Then next word you would play would be based on the feedback the computer gives you. The way I answered my question is I made a wordlist of which the computer will pick one of those words as your target word. Then the computer will run the game and select a word to guess. After your first guess the computer will receive feedback using these symbols (+, -, ' '). What I made these symbols mean is in the 5 character long word if you receive a + that means that letter is in that word and in that exact postion. If you receive a -, this means that letter is in the target word but not in that position. Lastly, if you receive a space or nothing, this means that those letters are not in the target word. The computer each time will analyze the output and put in another guess which will all be seen once you run the program from the output.
